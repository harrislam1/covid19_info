Question,Answer
"How does Coronavirus spread from person to person?","The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person. Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs."
"Can someone spread the virus without being sick?","People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest).Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms; there have been reports of this occurring with this new coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads."
"How easily does the corona virus spread?","How easily a virus spreads from person-to-person can vary. Some viruses are highly contagious (spread easily), like measles, while other viruses do not spread as easily. Another factor is whether the spread is sustained, spreading continually without stopping.The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community in some affected geographic areas."
"How do you protect yourself  from COVID-19 or Corona virus?","Older adults and people who have severe underlying chronic medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness. Please consult with your health care provider about additional steps you may be able to take to protect yourself."
"Is there a vaccine for the COVID-19?","There is currently no vaccine(as of March 27, 2020) to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person. Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs."
"What steps can I take to protect myself?","Clean your hands often. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Put distance between yourself and other people if COVID-19 is spreading in your community. This is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick."
"How do you protect others from COVID19?","Stay home if you’re sick. Stay home if you are sick, except to get medical care. Learn what to do if you are sick. Cover Your Cough. Cover coughs and sneezes. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow. Throw used tissues in the trash. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol."
"Should I wear a mask if I have Corona virus?","Wear a facemask if you are sick. If you are sick: You should wear a facemask when you are around other people (e.g., sharing a room or vehicle) and before you enter a healthcare provider’s office. If you are not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), then you should do your best to cover your coughs and sneezes, and people who are caring for you should wear a facemask if they enter your room. Learn what to do if you are sick."
"Should I wear a mask if I don't have Corona virus?","If you are NOT sick: You do not need to wear a facemask unless you are caring for someone who is sick (and they are not able to wear a facemask). Facemasks may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers."
"What is the risk of my child becoming sick with COVID-19 Corona virus or coronavirus or covid19?","Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults. While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date. You can learn more about who is most at risk for health problems if they have COVID-19 infection on CDC’s current Risk Assessment page."
"How can I protect my child from COVID-19 or covid19 or coronavirus or Corona virus infection?","You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy."
"How can I protect my children from COVID-19 infection?","Clean hands often using soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer"

"What is the risk to pregnant women of getting COVID-19?","Same risks as a regular adult, so ensure you take necessary precautions."
"Is it easier for pregnant women to become ill with the disease?","We do not currently know if pregnant women have a greater chance of getting sick from COVID-19 than the general public nor whether they are more likely to have serious illness as a result. Pregnant women experience changes in their bodies that may increase their risk of some infections. With viruses from the same family as COVID-19, and other viral respiratory infections, such as influenza, women have had a higher risk of developing severe illness. It is always important for pregnant women to protect themselves from illnesses. "
"If a pregnant woman has COVID-19 or Corona virus or coronavirus or covid19 during pregnancy, will it hurt the baby?","We do not know at this time what if any risk is posed to infants of a pregnant woman who has COVID-19. There have been a small number of reported problems with pregnancy or delivery (e.g. preterm birth) in babies born to mothers who tested positive for COVID-19 or Corona virus or coronavirus or covid19 during their pregnancy. However, it is not clear that these outcomes were related to maternal infection."

"Hello","Ask some corona virus related question please"
"Wassup","Ask some corona virus related question please"
"What's up?","Ask some corona virus related question please"
"Hola","Ask some corona virus related question please"
"AYYYE","here's some updated info relating to the virus: https://www.ontario.ca/page/2019-novel-coronavirus"
"How many people have died?","here's some updated info relating to the virus: https://www.ontario.ca/page/2019-novel-coronavirus"
"What is coronavirus?","Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19."
"Should I worry about COVID19?","We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our communities. First and foremost among these actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local health authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel, movement and gatherings."
"How long is the incubation period for COVID19, Coronavirus?","The 'incubation period' means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become available."
"How long does the coronavirus survive on surfaces?","It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment). If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose."
"Is COVID-19 airborne?","The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air. They quickly fall on floors or surfaces. You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within 1 metre of a person who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth before washing your hands."
"Can I catch coronavirus from my pet?","While there has been one instance of a dog being infected in Hong Kong, to date, there is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently and thoroughly."
"Is COVID-19 the same as SARS?","No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other genetically, but the diseases they cause are quite different. SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003."
"What is COVID-19?","COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people can become severely ill. Although most people with COVID-19 get better within weeks of illness, some people experience post-COVID conditions. Post-COVID conditions are a wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems people can experience more than four weeks after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Older people and those who have certain underlying medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19. Vaccines against COVID-19 are safe and effective."
"How does the virus spread?","COVID-19 is spread in three main ways: 1) Breathing in air when close to an infected person who is exhaling small droplets and particles that contain the virus. 2) Having these small droplets and particles that contain virus land on the eyes, nose, or mouth, especially through splashes and sprays like a cough or sneeze. 3) Touching eyes, nose, or mouth with hands that have the virus on them."
"What is community spread?","Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Each health department determines community spread differently based on local conditions. For information on community spread in your area, please visit your local health department’s website."
"How do I protect myself?","Get vaccinated, wear a mask, avoid crowds if possible, if not, stay 6ft away from people in public, wash your hands often and properly, clean and disinfect areas you interact with, cover your coughs and sneezes, and monitor your health on a daily basis."
"What should I do if I get sick or someone in my house gets sick?","1)People who have tested positive for COVID-19 within the past 3 months and recovered do not have to quarantine or get tested again as long as they do not develop new symptoms. 2)People who develop symptoms again within 3 months of their first bout of COVID-19 may need to be tested again if there is no other cause identified for their symptoms. 3) People who have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19 are not required to quarantine if they have been fully vaccinated against the disease and show no symptoms."
"What are some recommendations for someone who displays symptoms of COVID-19 or coronavirus?","Stay at home (except to get medical care). Separate yourself from others. Monitor your symptoms. Wear a mask over your nose and mouth when around others. Cover your coughs and sneezes. Wash your hands often. Clean high-touch surfaces every day. Avoid sharing personal household items."
"What is the risk of my child becoming sick with covid19?","Children can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and can get sick with COVID-19. Most children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms or they may have no symptoms at all (“asymptomatic”). Fewer children have been sick with COVID-19 compared to adults. Babies younger than 1 and children with certain underlying medical conditions may be more likely to have serious illness from COVID-19. Some children have developed a rare but serious disease that is linked to COVID-19 called multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C)."
"What is multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children(MIS-C)?","Multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) can affect children (MIS-C) and adults (MIS-A). MIS is a rare but serious condition associated with COVID-19 in which different body parts become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs."
"When should I seek emergency care if I have COVID-19?","Seek emergency medical care immediately if you display any of the following: 1) Trouble breathing 2) Persistent pain or pressure in the chest 3) Inability to wake or stay awake 4) Pale, gray, or blue-colored skin, lips, or nail beds, depending on skin tone"
"Is at-home testing available?","Yes. At-home testing and collection allow you to collect a specimen at home and either send it to a testing facility or preform the test at home. You and your healthcare provider might consider either an at-home collection kit or an at-home test if you have signs and symptoms of COVID-19 or if you can’t get testing at a local healthcare facility."
"Should I be tested for a current infection?","Fully vaccinated people with no COVID-19 symptoms do not need to be tested following an exposure to someone with COVID-19. People who have tested positive for COVID-19 within the past 3 months and recovered do not need to get tested following an exposure as long as they do not develop new symptoms. People who have taken part in activities that put them at higher risk for COVID-19 because they cannot physically distance as needed to avoid exposure such as travel, attending large social or mass gatherings, or being in crowded or poorly-ventilated indoor settings should get tested."
"Can someone test negative and later test positive on a viral test for COVID-19?","Yes, it is possible. You may test negative if the sample was collected early in your infection and test positive later during this illness. You could also be exposed to COVID-19 after the test and get infected then. Even if you test negative, you still should take steps to protect yourself and others. "
"Can I get COVID-19 from pets?","Based on the available information to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low."
"Can animals carry the virus on their fur or on their skin?","Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets."
"Can I use hand sanitizer on pets?","Do not wipe or bathe your pet with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or other products, such as hand sanitizer, counter-cleaning wipes, or other industrial or surface cleaners. If you have questions about appropriate products for bathing or cleaning your pet, talk to your veterinarian. If your pet gets hand sanitizer on their skin or fur, rinse or wipe down your pet with water immediately. If your pet ingests hand sanitizer (such as by chewing the bottle) or is showing signs of illness after use, contact your veterinarian or pet poison control immediately. "
"What should I do if my pet gets sick and I think it's COVID-19?","Most pets that have gotten sick from the virus that causes COVID-19 were infected after close contact with a person with COVID-19. Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets. If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19. If you are sick with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself. Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets. Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pet’s treatment and care. Routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended at this time."
"Can wild animals spread the virus that causes COVID-19 to people or pets?","Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States."
"What is community mitigation?","Community mitigation is a set of actions that people and communities can take to slow the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19. The goal of community mitigation in areas with local COVID-19 transmission is to slow its spread and to protect all individuals, especially those at increased risk for severe illness, while minimizing the negative impacts of these strategies."
"Can bats in the United States get the virus that causes COVID-19, and can they spread it back to people? ","Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats. In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we don’t yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick. Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States. Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19. However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people. Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19."
